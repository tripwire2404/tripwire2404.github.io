            <h2>About The Website & The Session</h2>
            <p>This is to tell the world about the session between Ebanks and R. Kelly. It is a website dedicated to sharing information, updates, and songs from this historic collaboration.</p>

            <h2>Why Do I Do This?</h2>
            <p>Initially, I was going to keep these songs to myself after recieving this from a colleague who knew a sound engineer who had access to the session recordings. However, since Ebanks thinks he's Playboi Carti and doesn't want to give us anything until his cover of "I Love The Dough"
                (with features I won't disclose) comes out, I decided to share these songs with you all. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. (except for the freestyle. Ebanks can't rap for SHIT.)</p>

            <h2>FAQ:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Q: Did Ebanks know you were doing this? And if so, how did he feel about it?</strong></li> 
                <li>A: Ebanks was aware that I was doing this, and he was not happy about it. He thought I was tarnishing his reputation, as well as the legacy R. Kelly had left before prison. 
                Do I care? Not at all. </li>
                <li><strong>Q: How did you get the recordings?</strong></li>
                <li>A: I got the recordings from a colleague who knew a sound engineer who had access to the session recordings. The sound engineer was not involved in the session, but he had access to the recordings.</li>
                <li><strong>Q: Are these the only songs from the session?</strong></li>
                <li>A: No, these are not the only songs from the session. There are more songs that I have not shared yet, but I will share them when I have access to them. My colleague only had access to 5 of the many songs recorded that night.</li>
                <li><strong>Q: Who are the producers involved in this session?</strong></li>
                <li>A: I don't have exact details, but I will try and get something out there. I will update this page with the information when I have it.</li>
                <li><strong>Q: Could I use these songs?</strong></li>
                <li>A: I would not recommend it for any big projects, like videos or movies or whatnot. For edits, do whatever you want.</li>
                <li><strong>Q: How do you feel about Ebanks now?</strong></li>
                <li>A: I don't know. I'm still processing it all. I think he has talent, but he is not all that. He needs to get his head out the damn clouds.</li>
