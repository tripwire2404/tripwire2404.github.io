                    <h3>UPDATE 1.1</h3>
                    <h2>A blog post regarding certain future songs</h2>
                    <p>We have some good news and bad news. The good news is this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We have located several more songs from the session that will be uploaded soon.</li>
                        <li>We are working on improving the website's design and functionality.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The bad news is this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Due to the controversial nature of some of the content, we may face legal challenges in uploading certain songs.</li>
                        <li>Some songs may take longer to upload than anticipated due to quality issues with the original recordings. This may result in some songs being edited or removed entirely.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We are stating this as some of the artists involved have since cut ties with Ebanks and R. Kelly due to various controversies.
                        We had a case a while ago where one of these artists, specifically the Great Cow Father, had an issue with us uploading one of the few songs he had a feature on due to what Ebanks did the last time he was invited over to his farm.
                        His verse was recorded during the madness of that situation, so he asked us to not upload, or at the very least shorten or edit out his verse from the song as he admitted to nearly raping Ebanks because of how angry he was.
                        We are trying to respect the wishes of all artists involved while still providing as much content as we can.
                        Thank you for understanding. </p>
                    <h3>And without further ado, I'm pleased to announce the following upcoming songs:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Farm On The Hill" - The Great Cow Father, featuring Ebanks. The session just so happened to take place the night before the farm incident. Since it's his song and not Ebanks's, Mr. Farmer himself gave us the go ahead to upload it. He intends to include it as a bonus on his next album vinyl for those who buy it in stores within the first month of the vinyl releasing.</li>
                            <li>"ALL FOR THE TAKING" - A gritty trap song by Ebanks, featuring The Great Cow Father as well as a hidden feature who we won't disclose just yet. This song is the one The Great Cow Father wanted us to not upload or at least edit his verse out of or trim. We will provide alternate versions of this song for those who want to hear the original version with his verse included. He also wanted it out because this was intended to be a diss towards a close affiliate of the Great Cow Father, who was angry upon finding out.</li>
                            <li>"08152022 Give Me A Reason" - A heartfelt solo song by Ebanks. This was recorded in the early hours of the morning, approximately 2 AM, 3 and 1/2 hours after R. Kelly had to leave to prepare for his trial.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h6>P.S. Give Me A Reason wasn't the last song recorded that night, according to another sound engineer involved with the session. Ebanks didn't wrap things up until about 3:30 AM, for some reason. We don't know why he was up so late.</h6>
                    <h6>See you in a few weeks!</h6>
